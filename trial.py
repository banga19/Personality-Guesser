You are: practical, loyal, consistent, generous and kind.
You are  also prone to putting lots of importance on money and security.
Although you might think loving green means you love nature, according to color
psychology, those who love green desperately want to feel secure in both 
their finances and relationships. To them, how they are viewed by others is 
their greatest concern, and they really want to be seen as successful,
wealthy, and an important person in their social circles. They're also social
 butterflies and are probably on a diet as we speak.""")

Blue is the most popular prettiest color in the world.
You are: Calm, cool, and able to keep things more even keel than most.
Blue, the color of the ocean, is often associated with feelings of serenity,
 so those who love it are often able to find peace and tranquility in places where others do not.
 People who love to wear blue are said to be easy to get along with, reliable,
  and, for lack of a better word, lovable.""")

You want to make a lasting impression.
Studies have also found that both genders are more attracted to a person in red than any other color.
Although scientists aren't exactly sure why, they think it may have to do with the fact that when someone blushes they
turn red and there's some sort of animalistic, sexual attraction there. People whose favorite color is red are usually
aware the effect it has, and are extroverted and confident enough to take advantage of it.
Interestingly, it's also been found that a preference for the color red increases
 for women when they've reached peak fertility in their menstrual cycle.

People who are drawn to purple are sort of hippy-like in the way they impractically tackle the world with their utopian ideals.

 It's probably best that they set up a Tarot card reading shop stat, and just get it over with already.""")

Those who adore orange want to be the center of attention, tend to be flamboyant in nature, and are not likely to have too many serious thoughts. They're friendly,
and people like that — until the overdose of flamboyancy kicks in, when friends tend to run.
According to Faber Birren, who studies color, those with a favorite color of orange are not as likely to marry,

Somewhere between black and white, grey is the color that just can't commit,

psychology, grey is emotionless, boring, detached, and indecisive.
Those who say their favorite color is grey don't tend to have any major
likes or dislikes. They can take or leave most things, and, on a whole,
lack the passion that comes with loving a 'real' color.""")

Those who favor pink do so because it's an escape from the reality of
impending adulthood. They're childlike in the way they interact with others,
and hope to be able to pull off red, pink's older sister,
when they finally grow up ― failing to realize they've been an adult for a

 Perfect example of the pink mentality: Girls' Shoshanna Shapiro.""")

Like Angelina Jolie, those who call black their favorite
color tend to be complicated realists with a need for control. Authority and independence are important to you.
Their realistic view of the world keeps their pessimism and moodiness in check,

It takes a certain type of personality to prefer yellow to all the other colors.
It involves a level of optimism that most people over the age of 10

yellow sometimes come off as whacky or aloof, but that's just because the
